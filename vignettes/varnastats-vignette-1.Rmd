This Vignette shows a workflow for archaeologists workig on burial sites. Starting point is a table with burials (objects) and their classified attributes (grave goods, orientation, size, sex etc.). An example dataset with 50 fictional burials and 18 stereotypical attributes is provided in `data/bs1`. Here's an extract of bs1:  

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
load("../data/bs1.rda")
knitr::kable(bs1[1:10,1:9], row.names = TRUE)
```
